## Game Idea

**Roleplaying + Chance + Grinding + Lore**

Main concept: **Catch a Bug!**



## Core Pillars

## Main Features

### Main Mechanics
**Bugs**
- Bugs fly around, rest on trees, and walk around.

**Player**
- Hunt with a weapon  
- Sell bugs  
- Index/collect bugs  
- **Flex bugs**

### Sub Mechanics
**Weapons**
- Luck stat  
- Simple accessories  

### Map

### Lore
Bugs are going missing one by one — your job is to collect every type of bug.



## Bug System

**Bug Properties:** Size, Rarity, Type, Animations, Destination

1. **Size**  
   Each bug has a size range. Each bug type has its own size variation.  
   Size affects sell price: bigger bug = higher sell value.

2. **Rarity**  
   Each rarity tier has its own set of bugs.  
   Higher rarity increases sell price more.

3. **Type**  
   *(TBD)*

4. **Animations**  
   *(TBD)*

5. **Destination**  
   When a bug spawns, the tree passes it a destination.  
   - If a player catches the bug before it reaches the destination → bug is collected.  
   - If it reaches the destination uncaught → bug despawns there.

## Planning

### Everyone (Tasks everyone should do)
**Deadline:** Continuous  
- Learn how to navigate **Roblox Studio**
- Know how to access this repo and add/remove files

### Implement Early Essential Scripts
**Seji, Ranv1rw**  
**Deadline:** Continuous  
- Create core systems:
  - Bug spawning from trees
  - Catching bugs
  - Sell/buy system
- Store all new scripts in the `scripts/` folder with a short description of:
  - what it does
  - where it belongs in Roblox Studio

### Early Game Models
**Seji, Pyro**  
**Deadline:** 05-01-2026  
- Trees, common bug types, and map
- Low-detail meshes, good enough for early testing
